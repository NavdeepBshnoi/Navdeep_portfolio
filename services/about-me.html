        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        
        <p>
      Hi there! 👋 I’m <strong>Navdeep Bishnoi</strong> — born and raised in the humble town of 
      <strong>Kaithal, Haryana</strong>. From sketching ideas on paper to building them into real designs,
      I’ve always been fascinated by how creativity and technology come together to solve human problems.  
      <br><br>
      I completed my graduation in <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong> from 
      <strong>Rayat Bahra University, Chandigarh</strong>, where I discovered my passion for 
      designing devices that could make healthcare smarter and more human.
      <br><br>
      My journey so far includes mastering <strong>SolidWorks</strong> for 3D design,
      <strong>ANSYS</strong> for simulations, and <strong>Python</strong> for coding and automation.
      Along the way, I developed a fun little game called <strong>“Go Next Go Color”</strong> — because sometimes,
      learning is even better with play! 🎮  
      <br><br>
      I also gained hands-on experience during a <strong>3-month hospital internship</strong> as a Biomedical Engineer,
      where I worked on real devices that impact real lives every day.
      <br><br>
      My ultimate goal? To <strong>create my own biomedical product</strong> — something that doesn’t just exist,
      but improves lives. Because innovation, to me, isn’t just about invention — it’s about impact.
